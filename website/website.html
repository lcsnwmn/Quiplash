			Overview
		</h1>

		<p id="paragraph_desc">
			The world wide web is used to share ideas and information 
			across the world. Beyond that it can also host web application
			and especially web games. This helps to give rise to
			the modern party game which our project explores. Our project was based off
			of the hit title Quiplash from Jackbox games. Our game runs through
			a web host that moderates player inputs and gives feedback about game 
			progression. For aesthetic purposes the project utilizes imagery generated
			in Maya and animated using photoshop. Our application can be accessed
			through any browser under any operating system such as Windows or MacOS. All
			of the resources and code used in the project can be accessed via GitHub:<br>

			To deploy the game it is sufficient to access

			Design and Implementation
		</h1>

		<p id="paragraph_desc">
			The game style as stated before is a party game, based around humour and wordplay.
			The game asks a select set of players a couple questions, these questions are then presented
			to other players who then vote on their favorite answers. Below is a basic run through of the
			game cycle:
		</p>
		<div id="fancy_background">
			<br>
			<p id="paragraph_desc_noIndent">
				The game starts:<br>
				- Players enter the game with a username.<br>
				- A question is presented to the players.<br>
				- Players answer their assigned questions.<br>
				- The answers and question are presented to players.<br>
				- The players vote on their favorite answer.<br>
				- This cycle repeats for all questions and players.<br>
				- The scores are tallied and awarded to the players.<br>
			</p>

			The project was designed using standard web programming tools like HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
			But in order to have users send and receive information to a server, the Javascript technique
			AJAX was used. The overall structure of the web game project includes a server, a client console,
			and a mobile console. The server is programmed with Python, using the Python utility CherryPy to
			act as its main web application framework. For the project the work was primarily divided into 
			Javascript, HTML/CSS, and Python Server. There was also some work done in creating the website imagery
			using Maya. Matthew Fabian worked on the Python Server and Javascript with AJAX along with
			contributing to HTML. Brandon Hansen primarily worked on HTML/CSS and some of the Javascript, along with
			the Maya imagery.

			What was Accomplished and Learned
		</h1>

		<p id="paragraph_desc">
			A general prototype of the game has been made with a functional server, general web page formatting, 
			webpage to server communications, and general styling. We both learned a great deal 
			about scalable web design along with programming in Javascript with HTML/CSS style principles. 
			Teamwork was also learned as usual. Teamwork makes the dreamwork.
